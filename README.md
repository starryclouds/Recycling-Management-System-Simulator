# Recycling-Management-System-Simulator

This is a recycling management system simulator. It consists of two main components:
recycling machines (RCMs) and recycling monitoring stations (RMOSs).
The RCMs allow people to recycled items and recieve money for the items they have recycled based on weight.
The RMOSs allow the admin to see usage statistics for the RCMs, add/change the items accepted at a RCM, empty the RCMs, and to restock the RCMs.

To login to the RMOS in the demo:
